### Bolt.Samples
The repository containing samples of Bolt based services.

#### BoltContactList
<https://github.com/justkao/Bolt.Samples/tree/master/BoltContactList>

Example of simple Bolt based service.
* **Client** - WPF application
* **Server** - Katana based host with Entity framework as database backend and Bolt for request handling
* **Contract** - Interface that is describing the service
```c#
public interface IContactListProvider
{
    Task<List<Contact>> GetContactsAsync(CancellationToken cancellation);

    Task<Contact> AddContactAsync(Contact contact, CancellationToken cancellation);

    Task DeleteContactAsync(int contactId, CancellationToken cancellation);

    [AsyncOperation]
    bool DoesContactExist(int contactId, CancellationToken cancellation);
}
```

The client and server code is automaticaly generated by Bolt framework. Bolt fully supports async operations with cancellation support. 
Marking synchronous method with `AsyncOperation` attribute will generate asynchronous version of such method.

#### MemoService
<https://github.com/justkao/Bolt.Samples/tree/master/MemoService>

Bolt based service with session support that is using protocol buffer serialization for transport.

* **Client** - WPF application with multiple windows ( one window per session )
* **Server** - Katana based host with Bolt integration
* **Contract**
```c#
public interface IMemoService
{
    [InitSession]
    void Login(string userName);

    void AddMemo(string memo);

    void RemoveMemo(string memo);

    List<string> GetAllMemos();

    [CloseSession]
    void Logoff();
}
```
